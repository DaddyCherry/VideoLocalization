Let's begin by familiarizing ourselves with different storage services.
You will learn about Azure Storage Account and how it
relates to various available storage services.
We'll also discuss blow up storage tiers, data redundancy options
and ways to move data or even entire infrastructures to
Azure.
And now let's dive into our data storage starting with
Storage accounts.
A storage account provides unique namespace for data in Azure
Storage services, accessible from anywhere in the world via HTTP
or https://protocols.
Azure Storage account contains all data objects of Azure Storage
Services, large binary objects or blobs, files, queues and tables.
Data in a storage account is protected, highly available, reliable
and scalable.
When creating a storage account, you first need to choose
an account type.
The account type influences the storage services and the redundancy
options affecting the way you can use it.
But what do I mean by redundancy options, you might
ask?
In a storage, multiple copies of data are always stored
to protect against planned or unplanned events such as hardware,
network, or power failures.
Natural disaster and more redundancy ensures that your storage account
meets the target availability and durability even in the event
of failures.
When deciding on the best redundancy option for your scenario
and to find the optimal balance between cost and high
availability locally redundant storage LRS replicates data three times.
Using a single data centre in the primary region, LRS
ensures object durability of at least 99 point 999999 percent,
that is 11 ninth over a given year.
